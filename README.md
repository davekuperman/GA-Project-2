# FRELPER
you can view the 
## The all round freight helper app
Frelper is an online platform hoping to bridge the gap between carrier and shipper, either looking for work or looking for someone to do the work. Frelper aims to save time for both parties by reducing unneccesary web searches and emails that would traditionally be used in the industry.


## Functionality
Depending on whether you are a carrier or a shipper, wou will be  fed different information.
With the current iteration of the app carriers are able to login, update their profile and also have the option to delete their profile should they wish to leave the platform.
The shipper is able to login, view a list of all the carriers and their information, along with being able to click into their profile and receive more information such as seeing an image of the carrier.

## Technology Used
 - Python with flask
 - HTML
 - JAVAscript
 - CSS with bootstrap
 - PostgreSQL
 - Psycopg2
 - Jinja

 ## Future additions
Due to time constraints certain features and functions did not make it onto the current iteration of the application. The following is a list of what I would like to add:
 - The ability for carriers to be able to select a job and provide updates on the progress of the job
 - Update, edit, delete options for the shippers
 - Ability for the shipper to rate the carrier and display an average of the carriers rating
 - Ability to comment on the carrier profile
